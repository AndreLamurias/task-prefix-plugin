## Testing

Run `NODE_OPTIONS=--experimental-vm-modules npm test` to run the tests.

If it complains about jsdom being absent, run `npm install -D jest-environment-jsdom` and try again.

### With JetBrains

If you are using a JetBrains IDE (Webstorm, Rubymine, anything that speaks Javascript), you can get an 
excellent debugging environment to run your tests.

[Read how to set up tests with this environment in JetBrains IDEs](https://public.amplenote.com/GPTbAGiRYddSCLtuTXGS1tSo).

### Run tests continuously as modifying the plugin

```bash
NODE_OPTIONS=--experimental-vm-modules npm run test -- --watch
```
